The first requirement for me is to create a jira ticket . Explain the CI - CD pipeline inside the ticket.
The first thing we are going to do is to build and deploy the same in tomcat servder
setup CI/CD with Github,Jenkins, Maven and Tomcat
set up jenkins
set up and configure maven and git
set up tomcat server
Integrate github maven tomcat server with Jenkins
create a ci and cd job with the code analysis
Once the deployment is run we will deploy it in the tomcat

Now during this I want a post notificaiton using slack notification in every step that you encounter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
